Git Extensions
==============

A collection of useful scripts extending git written in Python.
I plan on expanding these in the future - right now, the only script is
git-recent.

Installation
------------

    sudo python setup.py install

git-recent
----------

Performs a directory listing, and orders by most recently changed by a
commit in git.
